**About** <br/>
This is a student project of the university of St. Gallen of the course Advanced Programming.
The goal of the project was to create a supervised learning classifier which recognises digits from 0 to 9.
The classifier is based on training and test datasets provided by the MNIST data base. The main work of this project is based on [this tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-for-mnist-handwritten-digit-classification/#:~:text=MNIST%20Handwritten%20Digit%20Classification%20Dataset,-The%20MNIST%20dataset&text=It%20is%20a%20dataset%20of,from%200%20to%209%2C%20inclusively).
